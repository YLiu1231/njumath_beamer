This template was used for my thesis defense. However, I want to share this with all friends from the Department of Mathematics, NJU. 
I think it is very cool.

Here, I state that there is no copyright reserved. You can edit it, modify it, even crash it. Have fun!

Pro.Zhang Gaofei is a genius in the Department of Mathematics. He often says fancy speeches with so much wisdom. He is one of my favorite professors in NJU.

Last but not last, I want to express heartfelt thanks to my three roommates. Without your help and care, I would lose myself on the way here. Especially, Jinyang Wang gives me a lot of advice and comments on technical work and study. Love you guys forever.
